corpus = """Viruses are microscopic organisms that exist almost everywhere on earth. They can infect animals, plants, fungi, and even bacteria.

Sometimes a virus can cause a disease so deadly that it is fatal. Other viral infections trigger no noticeable reaction.

A virus may also have one effect on one type of organism, but a different effect on another. This explains how a virus that affects a cat may not affect a dog.

Viruses vary in complexity. They consist of genetic material, RNA or DNA, surrounded by a coat of protein, lipid (fat), or glycoprotein. Viruses cannot replicate without a host, so they are classified as parasitic.

They are considered the most abundant biological entity on the planet.Almost every ecosystem on Earth contains viruses.

Before entering a cell, viruses existTrusted Source in a form known as virions.

During this phase, they are roughly one-hundredth the size of a bacterium and consist of two or three distinct parts:

genetic material, either DNA or RNA
a protein coat, or capsid, which protects the genetic information
a lipid envelope is sometimes present around the protein coat when the virus is outside of the cell
Viruses do not contain a ribosome, so they cannot make proteins. This makes them totally dependent on their host. They are the only type of microorganism that cannot reproduce without a host cell.

After contacting a host cell, a virus will insert genetic material into the host and take over that host’s functions.

After infecting the cell, the virus continues to reproduce, but it produces more viral protein and genetic material instead of the usual cellular products.

It is this process that earns viruses the classification of parasite.

Viruses have different shapes and sizes, and they can be categorized by their shapes.

These may be:

Helical: The tobacco mosaic virus has a helix shape.
Icosahedral, near-spherical viruses: Most animal viruses are like this.
Envelope: Some viruses cover themselves with a modified section of cell membrane, creating a protective lipid envelope. These include the influenza virus and HIV.A virus exists only to reproduce. When it reproduces, its offspring spread to new cells and new hosts.

The makeup of a virus affects its ability to spread.

Viruses may transmit from person to person, and from mother to child during pregnancy or delivery.

They can spread through:

touch
exchanges of saliva, coughing, or sneezing
sexual contact
contaminated food or water
insects that carry them from one person to another
Some viruses can live on an object for some time, so if a person touches an item with the virus on their hands, the next person can pick up that virus by touching the same object. The object is known as a fomite.

As the virus replicates in the body, it starts to affect the host. After a period known as the incubation period, symptoms may start to show.

What happens if viruses change?
When a virus spreads, it can pick up some of its host’s DNA and take it to another cell or organism.

If the virus enters the host’s DNA, it can affect the wider genome by moving around a chromosome or to a new chromosome.

This can have long-term effects on a person. In humans, it may explain the development of hemophilia and muscular dystrophy.

This interaction with host DNA can also cause viruses to change.

Some viruses only affect one type of being, say, birds. If a virus that normally affects birds does by chance enter a human, and if it picks up some human DNA, this can produce a new type of virus that may be more likely to affect humans in future.

This is why scientists are concerned about rare viruses that spread from animals to people."""

#corpus = """The Xbox Series X and the Xbox Series S (collectively the Xbox Series X/S[b]) are home video game consoles developed by Microsoft They were both released on November 10, 2020 as the fourth generation of the Xbox console family succeeding the Xbox One family Along with Sony's PlayStation 5 also released in November 2020, the Xbox Series X and Series S are part of the ninth generation of video game consoles. Rumors regarding the consoles first emerged in early 2019, with the line as a whole codenamed "Scarlett", and consisting of high-end and lower-end models codenamed "Anaconda" and "Lockhart" respectively. Internally, Microsoft had been satisfied with the two-console approach for the Xbox One, and planned a similar approach for the fourth generation Xbox, with the target for the high-end model to at least double the performance of the Xbox One X. The high-end model was first teased during E3 2019 under the title "Project Scarlett", while its name and design as Xbox Series X was unveiled during The Game Awards later in December. In September 2020, Microsoft unveiled the lower-end model as the Xbox Series S. The Xbox Series X has higher end hardware, and supports higher display resolutions (up to 8K resolution) along with higher frame rates and real-time ray tracing; it also has a high-speed solid-state drive to reduce loading times. The less expensive Xbox Series S uses the same CPU, but has a less powerful GPU, has less memory and internal storage, and lacks an optical drive. Both consoles are backwards compatible with many previous generation Xbox games, controllers, and accessories. As part of a program Microsoft calls "Smart Delivery", many previous generation games feature upgraded graphics on the Series X/S at no additional charge. The consoles are also compatible with the gaming subscription service Xbox Game Pass, as well as the cloud game-streaming platform Xbox Game Pass cloud gaming."""

#corpus = """Economic writings date from earlier Mesopotamian, Greek, Roman, Indian subcontinent, Chinese, Persian, and Arab civilizations. Economic precepts occur throughout the writings of the Boeotian poet Hesiod and several economic historians have described Hesiod himself as the "first economist". Other notable writers from Antiquity through to the Renaissance include Aristotle, Xenophon, Chanakya (also known as Kautilya), Qin Shi Huang, Thomas Aquinas, and Ibn Khaldun.

Both groups were associated with the rise of economic nationalism and modern capitalism in Europe. Mercantilism was an economic doctrine that flourished from the 16th to 18th century in a prolific pamphlet literature, whether of merchants or statesmen. It held that a nation's wealth depended on its accumulation of gold and silver. Nations without access to mines could obtain gold and silver from trade only by selling goods abroad and restricting imports other than of gold and silver. The doctrine called for importing cheap raw materials to be used in manufacturing goods, which could be exported, and for state regulation to impose protective tariffs on foreign manufactured goods and prohibit manufacturing in the colonies. Physiocrats, a group of 18th-century French thinkers and writers, developed the idea of the economy as a circular flow of income and output. Physiocrats believed that only agricultural production generated a clear surplus over cost, so that agriculture was the basis of all wealth. Thus, they opposed the mercantilist policy of promoting manufacturing and trade at the expense of agriculture, including import tariffs. Physiocrats advocated replacing administratively costly tax collections with a single tax on income of land owners. In reaction against copious mercantilist trade regulations, the physiocrats advocated a policy of laissez-faire, which called for minimal government intervention in the economy. Adam Smith (1723–1790) was an early economic theorist. Smith was harshly critical of the mercantilists but described the physiocratic system "with all its imperfections" as "perhaps the purest approximation to the truth that has yet been published" on the subject."""

Pranu: Watched the trailer Jay mama seems pretty much interesting will give it a watch  Pranu: For sure  Jay Mama: So funny pranu  Jay Mama: Similar to somebody , nobody jokes  Pranu: Ya 😆😆  Pranu: Who’s not gonna like it?  Pranu: Jay mama suggest me a power bank for the phone I badly need one!  Pranu: Especially with a lower battery capacity for the iPhone 7  Jay Mama: What happened any problem with phone pranu  Pranu: Generally the battery of iPhone 7 is less right it gets completed soon and also recently while taking exam the power was gone and I had 7% charge on the phone so I felt the need of a power bank and also that would be helpful when I go to college Jay mama  Pranu: So even amma was asking for a power bank without need to carry a charger   Jay Mama: Ok buy 10000 or 15000 mah power bank  Pranu: Ya thought the same Jay mama! So MI power bank would be nice right?  Jay Mama: Yes 👍🏻  Jay Mama: All are same  Pranu: Ohh ok  Jay Mama: Eey killer DP pic 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻  Pranu: Thank you Jay mama*

#corpus = """Economic writings date from earlier Mesopotamian, Greek, Roman, Indian subcontinent, Chinese, Persian, and Arab civilizations. Economic precepts occur throughout the writings of the Boeotian poet Hesiod and several economic historians have described Hesiod himself as the "first economist". Other notable writers from Antiquity through to the Renaissance include Aristotle, Xenophon, Chanakya (also known as Kautilya), Qin Shi Huang, Thomas Aquinas, and Ibn Khaldun. Joseph Schumpeter described Aquinas as "coming nearer than any other group to being the "founders' of scientific economics" as to monetary, interest, and value theory within a natural-law perspective.[34][failed verification] A seaport with a ship arriving A 1638 painting of a French seaport during the heyday of mercantilism Two groups, who later were called "mercantilists" and "physiocrats", more directly influenced the subsequent development of the subject. Both groups were associated with the rise of economic nationalism and modern capitalism in Europe. Mercantilism was an economic doctrine that flourished from the 16th to 18th century in a prolific pamphlet literature, whether of merchants or statesmen. It held that a nation's wealth depended on its accumulation of gold and silver. Nations without access to mines could obtain gold and silver from trade only by selling goods abroad and restricting imports other than of gold and silver. The doctrine called for importing cheap raw materials to be used in manufacturing goods, which could be exported, and for state regulation to impose protective tariffs on foreign manufactured goods and prohibit manufacturing in the colonies. Physiocrats, a group of 18th-century French thinkers and writers, developed the idea of the economy as a circular flow of income and output. Physiocrats believed that only agricultural production generated a clear surplus over cost, so that agriculture was the basis of all wealth. Thus, they opposed the mercantilist policy of promoting manufacturing and trade at the expense of agriculture, including import tariffs. Physiocrats advocated replacing administratively costly tax collections with a single tax on income of land owners. In reaction against copious mercantilist trade regulations, the physiocrats advocated a policy of laissez-faire, which called for minimal government intervention in the economy. Adam Smith (1723–1790) was an early economic theorist. Smith was harshly critical of the mercantilists but described the physiocratic system "with all its imperfections" as "perhaps the purest approximation to the truth that has yet been published" on the subject."""

"""### **My Predictions**"""

corpus = """Viruses are microscopic organisms that exist almost everywhere on earth. They can infect animals, plants, fungi, and even bacteria.

Sometimes a virus can cause a disease so deadly that it is fatal. Other viral infections trigger no noticeable reaction.

A virus may also have one effect on one type of organism, but a different effect on another. This explains how a virus that affects a cat may not affect a dog.

Viruses vary in complexity. They consist of genetic material, RNA or DNA, surrounded by a coat of protein, lipid (fat), or glycoprotein. Viruses cannot replicate without a host, so they are classified as parasitic.

They are considered the most abundant biological entity on the planet.Almost every ecosystem on Earth contains viruses.

Before entering a cell, viruses existTrusted Source in a form known as virions.

During this phase, they are roughly one-hundredth the size of a bacterium and consist of two or three distinct parts:

genetic material, either DNA or RNA
a protein coat, or capsid, which protects the genetic information
a lipid envelope is sometimes present around the protein coat when the virus is outside of the cell
Viruses do not contain a ribosome, so they cannot make proteins. This makes them totally dependent on their host. They are the only type of microorganism that cannot reproduce without a host cell.

After contacting a host cell, a virus will insert genetic material into the host and take over that host’s functions.

After infecting the cell, the virus continues to reproduce, but it produces more viral protein and genetic material instead of the usual cellular products.

It is this process that earns viruses the classification of parasite.

Viruses have different shapes and sizes, and they can be categorized by their shapes.

These may be:

Helical: The tobacco mosaic virus has a helix shape.
Icosahedral, near-spherical viruses: Most animal viruses are like this.
Envelope: Some viruses cover themselves with a modified section of cell membrane, creating a protective lipid envelope. These include the influenza virus and HIV.A virus exists only to reproduce. When it reproduces, its offspring spread to new cells and new hosts.

The makeup of a virus affects its ability to spread.

Viruses may transmit from person to person, and from mother to child during pregnancy or delivery.

They can spread through:

touch
exchanges of saliva, coughing, or sneezing
sexual contact
contaminated food or water
insects that carry them from one person to another
Some viruses can live on an object for some time, so if a person touches an item with the virus on their hands, the next person can pick up that virus by touching the same object. The object is known as a fomite.

As the virus replicates in the body, it starts to affect the host. After a period known as the incubation period, symptoms may start to show.

What happens if viruses change?
When a virus spreads, it can pick up some of its host’s DNA and take it to another cell or organism.

If the virus enters the host’s DNA, it can affect the wider genome by moving around a chromosome or to a new chromosome.

This can have long-term effects on a person. In humans, it may explain the development of hemophilia and muscular dystrophy.

This interaction with host DNA can also cause viruses to change.

Some viruses only affect one type of being, say, birds. If a virus that normally affects birds does by chance enter a human, and if it picks up some human DNA, this can produce a new type of virus that may be more likely to affect humans in future.

This is why scientists are concerned about rare viruses that spread from animals to people."""
